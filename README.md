<h1 align="center">Face Detection</h1>

<p align="center">Using basic haarcascades from OpenCV, an inital face detection was implemented with Flask in order to show how many people are looking at the camera at a given time. This was implemented on a Raspberry Pi 3 as well and used as a demo at CES 2018. A video of the script at work is seen below along with the preliminary code.</p>
